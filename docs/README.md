Discord HTML Transcripts is a node.js module to generate nice-looking HTML transcripts. Processes discord markdown like **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethroughs~~, and more. Nicely formats attachments and embeds to match the look and feel of Discord. Includes built-in XSS protection, preventing users from inserting arbitrary HTML tags.
